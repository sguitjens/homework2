					I am the first being Princess Bubblegum ever created, and I live in a realm also called Lemongrab. Some say I am socially dysfunctional, and have trouble interacting with Candy Kingdom citizens due to my intolerance towards anything happy or comical. To that I say, "Twelve years dungeon. All of you. Dungeon. Seven years, no trials. C'mon, let's move it!" The following is a summary of my accomplishments, which you may view at your leisure on Cartoon Network.
				</p>
				<p>
					In "Too Young," I take over as ruler of the Candy Kingdom when Bubblegum is deemed too young after being de-aged in the events of "Mortal Recoil". I determine that "This castle is in unacceptable condition! Unacceptable!" and jail most of the candy subjects before Bubblegum returns to her original age.
				</p>
				<p>   
					In "You Made Me," I spy on the candy citizens while they sleep, which upsets Bubblegum. She attempts to fix me by giving me subjects to rule over; but when this fails, Bubblegum clones me so I have someone who understands me. Since then, I wear a black uniform, while my clone brother dons a similar white uniform.
				</p>
				<p>    
					In "All Your Fault", after Bubblegum forgets to take the instructions of creating life with her, my brother and I begin making similar-minded lemon candy citizens out of the food that she sent to us. Sadly, Bubblegum manages to wipe the knowledge from our minds.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the events of "Another Five More Short Graybles" I become an overweight despot after eating part of my clone brother after he accidentally breaks our "child" Lemonsweets.
				</p>
				<p>
					In "Too Old", I swallow my now-crippled and repenting brother after Princess Bubblegum takes away one of our subjects, a lemon boy named Lemonhope.
				</p>
				<p>
					In "Lemonhope", the eponymous lemon child overthrows me by using his soothing music to blow me up. Soon after, Princess Bubblegum manages to graft me back together with what remains of my brother and other lemon subjects caught in the explosion.
				</p>
				<p>
					The sixth-season episode "The Mountain" suggests that this new me, while still somewhat off, is a much more competent ruler.
